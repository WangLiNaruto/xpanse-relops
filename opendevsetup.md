# Xpanse Open Development Setup

This document outlines the steps taken to make of the Xpanse project
an environment fully open to anyone who wishes to contribute. Agile
methodology best practices, Eclipse Foundation release checklists, available
tools, etc. have all been vetted and taken in account while developing this
document (at the time of writing, ndr, Jun 2023).

## Code Repository

### Proposing features
We welcome all new ideas that can make the project better. If you would like to propose a new feature to be added to 
the Xpanse project, you can start a new `discussion` in the Xpanse project [here](https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/discussions).
Also mark the discussion category as `ideas` and also tag the project members so that we can look into it without delays.

## Milestones, issues and roadmap

## Development methodology
We follow agile develop methodology. All requirements are broken into user stories with short feedback cycle. 

But at the same time, we do not believe in going by the book of Scrum/Agile guidelines. We try to be as flexible as possible, 
avoid as much as meetings possible and focus mainly on shorter delivery cycles and feedback loops. 

### Sprints length
Each sprint starts on a Monday and is 2 weeks length. 

### Implemented agile methodology elements
Sprint planning - Happens every 2 weeks. 
Sprint reviews - Happens on alternate Monday's to review the Sprint progress.
Product Backlog - All requirements to backlog are added to the Xpanse project board. 
User stories - All requirements in the backlog is split into smaller user stories and created as GitHub `issues`
Self-Managing - We are a self-managing team, meaning we internally decide who does what, when, and how.
Definition of Done - We have a clear definition of done documented in every user story we implement.
